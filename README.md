#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

Welcome to my partial masterpiece. lol 

### Specification

 
### What do I do from here?

You code review this sonova bisch and let me know what I messed up again....have fun 

Put in your own google api code and run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000' in the command line 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write. 
Work on IE 11 No... it probably doesn't work on IE 11 but I'm on a Mac so not happening for testing.


### Extra Resources
Some of the other works that were not specifically given to me was a lot of google documentation, but most else I think was given to me directly from the course and links in the course.
